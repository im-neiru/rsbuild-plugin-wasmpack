# `rsbuild-plugin-wasmpack`

**This package is not yet unpublished**

`rsbuild-plugin-wasmpack` is a plugin for [rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) that enables you to compile and build Rust crates into WebAssembly (Wasm) using [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/).

This plugin simplifies the integration of Rust to WebAssembly in your rsbuild projects, allowing you to easily compile and bundle your Rust code for use in web applications.



## Prerequisites

Before you can use this plugin, you'll need to have [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) installed.

```Shell
cargo install wasm-pack
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can add the plugin to your `rsbuild` configuration. Hereâ€™s an example configuration for compiling a Rust crate to WebAssembly:

### Example `rsbuild.config.js`

```typescript
import { pluginWasmPack } from "rsbuild-plugin-wasmpack";

export default {
  plugins: [
    pluginWasmPack({
      crate: "rust",        // The path to your Rust crate
      output: "wasm",       // The output directory for your wasm package
      target: "web",        // The target environment (e.g., 'web', 'nodejs')
    })
  ],
};
```

### Configuration Options

- `crate` (string): The path to your Rust crate or project. This is typically the folder containing `Cargo.toml` or the name of the crate if it's published on [crates.io](https://crates.io).

- `output` (string): The directory where the generated `.wasm` package will be placed.

- `target` (string): The WebAssembly target. Common options include:
  - `web`: For use in web browsers.
  - `nodejs`: For use in a Node.js environment.
  - More targets are supported by wasm-pack.
